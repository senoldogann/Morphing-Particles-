# Morphing Particles

A stunning interactive particle animation that morphs text into beautiful particle formations. Built with React, TypeScript, and HTML5 Canvas.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Particles**: Particles react to mouse movement with physics-based animations
- **Text Morphing**: Type any text and watch particles form into letters
- **Idle Animation**: Beautiful orbiting particle cluster when no text is displayed
- **Glow Effects**: Each particle has a radial glow for a premium visual effect
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes with HiDPI/Retina display support
- **Smooth Performance**: Optimized rendering with requestAnimationFrame

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/morphing-particles.git

# Navigate to project
cd morphing-particles

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React 19** - UI Framework
- **TypeScript** - Type Safety
- **Vite** - Build Tool
- **HTML5 Canvas** - Rendering Engine
- **TailwindCSS v4** - Styling

## 📖 How It Works

1. **Particle System**: Each particle has its own position, velocity, and physics properties
2. **Text Sampling**: Text is drawn to an offscreen canvas, then pixel data is sampled to create particle positions
3. **Spring Physics**: Particles use spring-based forces for smooth, natural movement
4. **Mouse Interaction**: Particles are repelled by the mouse cursor

## 🎨 Customization

You can customize the particle behavior by modifying these values in `ParticleNetwork.tsx`:

- `colors` - Array of particle colors for idle mode
- `numberOfParticles` - Particle count in idle mode
- `step` - Particle density for text mode
- `maxDistance` - Mouse interaction radius
